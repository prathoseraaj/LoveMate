# LoveMate

> _Looking for love? Well, this app might help you – but just to be clear, it's here for **you**, not for, you know... "me". I'm already in a committed relationship with sarcasm and caffeine. So, let's keep things professional, shall we?_

## What is LoveMate?

**LoveMate** is your virtual companion for love and relationship advice. Ask it anything, and it will respond with (hopefully) sweet, romantic, and supportive messages. No emojis here—because we're keeping it subtle, just like that "friend" who says they're not interested but keeps liking all your posts.

## Features

- Ask questions about love, relationships, or why your plants keep dying (wait, that's a different app).
- Sarcasm not included, but highly recommended (as you can see).
- Built with Next.js and Axios for easy deployment—none of that nasty FastAPI or Node stuff.

## Future Implementation

- Proper message window with old messages

_If you fall in love with this app, just remember: it's here for you. I'm just the messenger... and definitely not available for dates._
